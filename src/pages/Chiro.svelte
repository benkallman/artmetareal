  <h2>Artist: Ben Banker</h2>
  <p class="title">Gouache on 140 lb cold press paper</p>
  <p>2021 2022</p>
  <p>We are thrilled to announce the sale of an exceptional artwork, measuring 22" x 30", to a prominent chiropractor's office. The piece represents a stunning display of artistic prowess, crafted with meticulous attention to detail over a period of several months by the artist, based in Madison, WI.</p>
  <p>Drawing inspiration from the great Mark Rothko, the artist, Ben, was asked to incorporate the connection between parent and child, resulting in a mystical experience of color. By expertly contrasting the parent color with its children, the artwork showcases a remarkable use of blue, evoking a pleasurable experience for viewers. The interplay of color is so compelling that it creates an optical illusion, with the eyes experiencing a reverse afterimage effect reminiscent of gazing into the sun.</p>
  <p>As a testament to the artist's skill, the commissioned piece was completed in just a few months, reflecting Ben's dedication and unwavering commitment to his craft. This artwork is a testament to his unique vision and mastery of color, and we are thrilled that it has found a deserving home in a prominent chiropractor's office.</p>
