  <p>0x888 offers a diverse range of options for those interested in Ben's digital art. Along with the option to transform digital art into a painting, the website also features a leasing program for both homes and businesses. This leasing program allows for the option to buy or receive a commission on sales. Corporate spaces can also take advantage of an art subscription service which offers quarterly or yearly rotation of new artwork for the space.</p>
  <p>For those with a specific vision in mind, Ben is available for commission work. Together, the client and Ben can collaborate on the subject matter to create a one-of-a-kind piece. To enhance the ambiance of waiting rooms or professional spaces, 0x888 recommends their art books, which feature a selection of Ben's works.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, leasing options are available for prints, paintings, and TV and LED digital installations. Monthly leasing payments for artwork are 3% of the price of the leased piece and a satisfactory security deposit is required. The minimum lease term is three (3) months, and payments are nonrefundable. If the client chooses to exercise the right toward a buyout, all leasing charges paid during the first year will be credited toward the buyout price. The artwork must be installed by the gallery installation team, and installation fees start at $475 for up to 4 hours of onsite installation services. Building code standards must be met for 0x888 to insure against damages that may occur during the leasing period. Artwork selection is encouraged to be done in-person or through online booking to avoid costly mistakes.</p>
