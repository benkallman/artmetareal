<p>This profound artwork by Ben Banker, 'Dance 1', spanning 22" x 30", is the first act of a mesmerizing diptych that originated from a serene mountain site in Tennessee. While the majority of its creation flourished in Madison, WI, the piece was touched by sunlight and stream, enveloped in the tranquil sounds of nature. Banker's dedicated process, over the course of a year, absorbed the essence of the American West Coast and the Southwest's rugged beauty. Shaped by his experiences in dispersed camping areas and BLM land, this artwork embodies a synthesis of peaceful wilderness and artistic vitality.</p>
