  <p>Welcome to our private art classes, where creativity knows no bounds. Our classes are not just limited to one location, as we offer online classes as well. Our instructor, Benjamin Banker, is an expert in the field of drawing and painting, and is here to guide you every step of the way.</p>
  <p>We believe in tailor-made classes that cater to our students' interests, so you can choose between our standard class or a class that is structured around your interests. Our course curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including painting with acrylic, watercolor, gouache and oil, drawing, printing, and digital art - both for print and the internet, as well as NFT, AI image generation and glitch art.</p> 
  <p>We offer flexible payment options to suit your needs. You can opt for an annual membership at $896, payable quarterly, or choose to pay as you go at $30 per class. Additionally, we offer recurring weekly hourly courses at $20.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in joining our classes or have any queries, please feel free to contact Ben through his Instagram or Twitter handles, which you can find in the social media links below. We're excited to see what you create!</p>
