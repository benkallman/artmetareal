  <p>Excitedly presenting 'Smoke Two', a 22" x 30" exploration in gouache that captures a harmonious clash of abstraction and geometry. This piece, conceived by Ben Banker, a Madison, WI-based artist, is a masterful orchestration of form, line, and vibrancy. Each element in this composition is meticulously layered, creating a visual dance where colors and shapes intersect and diverge. The work's intricate details and ambitious scale are a testament to the artist's commitment to their craft, realized over several focused months. 'Convergence: Smoke Two' is not just a painting; it is an invitation to traverse the artist's rich inner landscape.</p>
