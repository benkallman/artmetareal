  <p>Ben Banker's 'Dance 2' is a poignant piece of a diptych, extending an invitation to a dance of colors and dreams. Originating from a record cover drawing created 25 years ago in Chicago, where the artist once worked at Modern Culture Studios, this sketch resided in obscurity before being reborn into this series. This work is a visual representation of a dream conveyed to Ben, where mist and water from waterfalls transformed into human silhouettesâ€”a vision so compelling it drove him to capture waterfalls across the nation, with the defining image emerging from the mountains near Denver. This 22" x 30" piece, cultivated over three years and informed by a life rich in movement and change, carries the essence of transient memory and the subtle power of shared visions onto the canvas.</p>
