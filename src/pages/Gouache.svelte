<p>Available for acquisition is this framed artwork by Ben Banker, an illustrious SAIC graduate. 'Paint' is an ecologically minded creation, born from the desire to use every last drop of gouache. Its layers, applied with conscientious intent, catalog a year of the artist's life spent in the studio, conserving and composing with the remnants from 'Their Wine is the Poison of Dragons', 'Dance One', and 'Dance Two'. Each layer represents a chronological narrative, the colors finding their place not by design, but by the serendipitous order of the artist's other works. Beyond its artistic allure, 'Paint' holds personal significance; it parallels an unseen version that Banker has been cultivating for years, a piece entwined with memories of creation and loss, particularly poignant as he was working on it when he learned of his father's passing. As Banker continues to develop this parallel piece, 'Paint' stands as a testament to the layers of experience, emotion, and the passage of time.</p>
