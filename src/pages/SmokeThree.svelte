  <p>It is with great enthusiasm that we present 'Smoke Three', a 22" x 30" piece that bursts with an exuberant array of colors. Crafted by the gifted Ben Banker, this artwork is a celebration of chromatic diversity, with hues that dance between the warm reds and cool blues, creating a visual symphony. Each stroke on the artwork is deliberate, infused with the artist's passion and reflective of his time spent in Madison, WI. The painting invites onlookers to lose themselves in a labyrinth of color, each turn revealing a new shade, a new emotion, a new story. This piece is not only a visual feast but also a narrative of color's boundless potential to evoke and heal.</p>
